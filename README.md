# Breaking Bad API

## Documentation

Welcome to the Breaking Bad API! This documentation will supply
with you all the information you need to start making your HTTP
requests on this iconic TV-series. Give our documentation a read before you get started on
your project, and don't forget about the ice trays!

## Base URL

https://www.breakingbadapi.com/api/

## Rate Limit

This API is free, I have no intention of creating authentication. However, to prevent harmful activity, there is a rate limit of 10,000 requests a day. If you happen to reach that limit, you will receive a 429 status code, and regain access after 24 hours.
